# Nasa EONET Frontend

## Overview

I built a frontend for the NASA EONET API in order to practice using API's, explore mapping with REACT-Leaflet, and because the data is amazing!

The site allows filtering of the data by various criteria- I'm particularly happy with the ablilty to filter by continent. 

The site is hosted by Netlify and can be found here : https://eonetevents.netlify.app
